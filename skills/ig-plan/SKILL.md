description: >-
  Build the week on Instagram - what to post, which format, when, and who to
  engage with. Use when the user says "plan my week", "what should I post",
  "content calendar", "I have nothing to post about", or wants a posting
  schedule and an engagement list.

# ig-plan

## Runtime (Codex and Claude)

- `SKILL_DIR` is the absolute directory of this loaded `SKILL.md`; resolve all
  scripts/resources there, never the working directory. Siblings use `../ig-human/`
  or `../ig-reel/`. Substitute real absolute paths for `$SKILL_DIR` and
  `$INSTAGRAM_DATA_DIR` before executing, or explicitly assign/quote those variables.
- Select the absolute data directory: explicit `INSTAGRAM_AGENT_HOME` > nearest
  existing `.instagram` in the user's project ancestry > `data_dir` from
  `instagram-config.json` beside this skill > `~/.agents/instagram` (Codex) or
  `~/.claude/instagram` (Claude). Create it for writes. Codex may read a missing
  state file from the matching `~/.claude/instagram/` file; always write selected dir.
- Cross-skill names mean follow their instructions, not execute shell/slash
  commands. Codex user prompts can invoke `$ig-reel`, for example.
- Use an available Python 3.10+ interpreter (`python3`, `python`, or `py -3`).
  If it is unavailable, explain the missing requirement; never invent tool scores.
- Read `voice.md` when present and use the user's language and supplied context;
  ask only for missing essentials.
  Requested local drafts/files need no repeated approval. The user publishes.
- Script language heuristics are English-focused. For other languages, preserve
  natural wording, review manually and explain score limits; do not chase English PASS.

The control room. Everything else in this pack executes; this decides what gets
executed. Run it once a week, on the same day.

## Input

If `$INSTAGRAM_DATA_DIR/voice.md`, `$INSTAGRAM_DATA_DIR/swipe.md` and
`$INSTAGRAM_DATA_DIR/log.md` exist, read them.
The swipe file is the user's own evidence from `ig-viral` about which formulas
are landing in their niche right now, and it outranks anything in this file.
The log helps avoid repeating a theme from the last fortnight. Distinguish
`draft`, `approved` and `posted` entries; do not count unposted plans as publication
history.

Use information already supplied even if the files do not exist. Ask only
for missing necessary details from these four things and write them down:

1. What the user sells, and to whom.
2. The three or four themes they want to be known for.
3. What actually happened this week: a client call, a number, a mistake, a
   thing they built, an argument they had. This is where posts come from.
4. Ten accounts worth being visible to.

## What to post

Four to five posts a week, and at least three of them Reels. Reels are the only
format on Instagram that reliably reaches people who do not follow the account.
Carousels go deep with the people who already do. Stories are daily and are
planned separately.

Mix across the week, never two of the same type back to back:

| type | share | job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Proof** | 1 per week | something that happened, with a number. Reel. |
| **Teach** | 1 to 2 per week | one thing the viewer can do today. Reel or carousel. |
| **Opinion** | 1 per week | a position that could lose you followers. Reel. |
| **Story** | 1 per fortnight | a scene with a cost. Reel. |
| **Offer** | 1 per fortnight | what you sell, said plainly, no apology. Carousel or stories. |

For each slot give: the theme, the specific angle from what actually happened
this week, the format, and the hook formula number from `../ig-reel/hooks.json`.
Not a topic, an angle. "AI" is not a plan. "The proposal we lost because the
draft had an em dash in it" is a Reel.

## When to post

Post when the user's audience is awake and not at work. For most consumer
audiences that is early evening local time; for a business audience, early
morning.

But say this plainly: **the hour matters far less than the first two seconds.**
Instagram will keep showing a Reel for days if it performs, and will bury a
well-timed one that does not. If the user is optimising posting times before
their hooks work, they are polishing the wrong thing, and you should say so.

Anchor times to the audience's timezone, not the user's, if those differ.

## The engagement round, which is not optional

20 minutes a day, before posting, not after. Build a list of 10:

- **5 reach** - accounts with an audience the user wants, where a good comment
  gets seen. Comment early, before the thread is 200 deep.
- **3 peers** - same size, same field. This is the group that reciprocates.
- **2 buyers** - people who could actually buy. Comment for weeks before any
  DM, and never pitch in a comment.

Hand the list to `ig-comment`.

  ...

Say "write Tuesday" and I will draft it.
```

Write the plan to `$INSTAGRAM_DATA_DIR/plan.md` so the other skills can read
it. Nothing is scheduled or posted anywhere. This is a plan and the user runs
it.
